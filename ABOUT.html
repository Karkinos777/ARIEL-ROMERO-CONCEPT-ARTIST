Ariel Romero is a concept artist and matte painter that enjoys working on a wide variety of projects. 
As a concept artist with 6 years of experience Ariel enjoys working on a variety of projects during pre-production ranging from environment concept art, character art and promotional art. 
Ariel believes that against all odds and adversity, hard work, dedication, intelligent decision making and over all burning passion will achieve any goal he sets for himself. He is very passionate about studding and constantly learning new and different techniques for concept painting such as 3D and 2D mixed media, photogating and montage, and impressionistic painting techniques.  
Ariel strongly believes in John Singer Sargentâ€™s philosophy of painting; styles are techniques to be used rather than an end representation in themselves and practicing the habit of effectively representing the subject in as few brushstrokes as possible.
Ariel also enjoys creating art in its traditional mediums, such as ink, charcoal, graphite and oil painting.
